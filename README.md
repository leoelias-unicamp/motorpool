# motorpool
This repository encompasses the source code of a spinal motor neuron pool with the network designed in [PyNN](https://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/), and the motor neuron models implemented using the [NEURON simulator](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/).

The model was coded in Python programming language by [Leonardo Abdala Elias](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a_E4McYAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2) (University of Campinas, Brazil) and [Francesco Negro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rpp9vjIAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2) (University of Brescia, Italy).
